This first chapter presents the theoretical foundation for the thesis.
The theory is grouped in four categories: \gls{NN}s, learning,
neuromorphic hardware, \index{neuromorphic} and finally
the cognitive theory of the Reorganisation of Elementary Functions
(\gls{REF}).

\section{Neural networks} \label{sec:nn}
\Gls{NN}s is a broad term that originates in the neuronal models from
biological brain \cite{Dayan2001}.
The general architecture of neural systems can be explained as circuits
of neurons \index{neuron} connected through weighted edges.
\cite{Russel2007, Dayan2001}.
In this abstract sense a neuron is defined as a computational unit that
takes a number of signals (inputs) and processes them through some
function $f$ that outputs a single value \cite{Eliasmith2004}.
From that perspective neural networks simply \textit{computes} an 
output based on some input why neural networks can be understood as
complex non-linear computations \cite{Eliasmith2004, Dayan2001}.

In a more concrete sense neural networks computes over either
continuous (e. g. voltage and numbers) or discrete signal, and they
can be modelled with or without a temporal dimension
\cite{Eliasmith2004, Russel2007, Schmidhuber2014}.

Discrete models without a temporal dimension were the foundation for
the first generation of neural networks \cite{Russel2007, Maass1997}.
They are based on the perceptron model as seen in equation
\ref{eq:perceptron}, also known as the McCulluch-Pitts neuron model
\cite{Eliasmith2004}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:perceptron}
f(x) = \begin{cases}
	 1 & \text{if } u > 0\\
	 0 & \text{otherwise}
       \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Second generation neural networks}
Second generation neural networks augment the perceptron model by
a) allowing continuous output values of a neuron and b) parametrising
the computation of the neuron by adding an \textit{activation function}
\index{activation function} for when the output ``activates'' 
\cite{Maass1997}.
\textit{Sigmoidal} functions are commonly used for activation functions
because they resemble the perceptron step function while 
retaining continuity (see figure \ref{fig:sigmoid})
\cite{Maass1997}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[domain=-6:6,xscale=0.3]
  \draw[->] (-6.2,0) -- (6.2,0) node[right] {$x$};
  \draw[->] (0,-0.2) -- (0,1.2) node[above] {$\sigma(x)$};
  \draw plot (\x,{1 / (1 + exp(-\x))}) node[right] {$\sigma(x) = {1 \over 1 + e^{-x}}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{A sigmoidal (soft step) function.}
\label{fig:sigmoid}
\end{figure}

A number of variations for sigmoidal activation functions exist such as the 
hyperbolic tangent ($tanh$) and
the rectified linear unit \index{ReLU} (ReLU, see equation \ref{eq:ReLU}). 
They are applied either in a feed-forward or recurrent (cyclic) manner, where
the recurrent variant are forced to cope with temporal transformations to
terminate\footnote{It is possible to \textit{unfold} recurrent
networks to resemble the circular processes until a certain point, achieving
a similar effect to temporal signal transformation, see \cite{Mozer1995}.}
\cite{Schmidhuber2014}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ReLU}
f(x) = \begin{cases}
         0 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
	 x & \text{otherwise}
       \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Second generation neuron models typically enrich the
input signals ($x$) with a weight ($w$) as shown in \ref{eq:weightedsum}
\cite{Schmidhuber2014, Russel2007}. 
Given $n$ input neurons, the weighted sum is the value of each
input neuron ($x_i$) scaled by a weight for that individual neuron ($w_i$).
Weights allow the model to adapt the relative importance of each
input neuron by modifying their weights, thus allowing the
model to \textit{train} to a given domain \cite{Schmidhuber2014, Russel2007}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:weightedsum}
u = w \cdot x = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i
\end{equation}

For each neuron $j$ the output $x$ can be derived as shown in 
\ref{eq:weightedoutput}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:weightedoutput}
  x_j = \sigma(u_j) = \sigma(\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i,j} x_i)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Third generation neural networks}
Constructing a network of neuron models essentially creates a non-linear
response to a given numerical vector \cite{Russel2007}.
This transformative view can be adopted to biological \gls{SNN}, where
the data being transferred are no longer vectors, but discrete
\textit{spikes} of electrical current \cite[p. 32]{Dayan2001, Eliasmith2004}.
In this case the activation of a spike can be understood as a function
of the electric current to the neuron cell along with the cell weights,
similar to the weighted sum in equation \ref{eq:weightedsum}
\cite[p. 234]{Dayan2001}.

There is a temporal dimension to this because signals in biological 
networks arrive from multiple sources in parallel \cite{Eliasmith2004}.
Lapicque presented the first model of conductance over time in 1907,
dubbed the \textit{integrate-and-fire} \index{neuron model!integrate-and-fire}
\index{integrate-and-fire|see {neuron model}}
model, because neurons essentially
integrate received current over time to determine whether they should fire 
\cite{Dayan2001, Eliasmith2004}.
The Dirac ($\delta$) function \index{Dirac function}
in equation \ref{eq:dirac} shows an idealised
version of this \cite[p. 404]{Dayan2001}.
For all values it approaches 0, except when its argument is
0 where it will grow infinitely.
The total area of these 'spikes' sum together to 1 over time $t$ \index{neuron spike}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dirac}
\int dt\ \delta(t) = 1
\end{equation}

This idealised representation is a common mathematical approximation of
a sequence of activation functions \cite{Dayan2001, Eliasmith2004},
and the foundation for the \textit{third} generation
neural networks, where the computations are understood as spikes over
time \cite{Maass1997}. \index{neuron spike} \index{spike|see {neuron spike}}
In this model the neurons receive a voltage that builds over time, until
it reaches a threshold voltage ($V_{th}$) and produces a single spike
\mbox{($\delta(t-t_n)$)}
\cite{Dayan2001, Eliasmith2004}.
In a brief period after the activation the neuron enters a period of
refraction, \index{refraction period}
where injected voltage is not accumulated, denoted by 
$\tau_{ref}$, illustrated in figure \ref{fig:spiking}
\cite[p. 82]{Eliasmith2004}.

A more realistic neuron model was developed by Hodgkin
and Huxley in 1952 dubbed the Hudgkin-Huxley model \cite{Dayan2001}.
While it is more precise than integrate-and-fire models, it is
more complex \cite[p. 195]{Dayan2001} and rarely used in simulations
\cite{Albada2018, Dayan2001, Eliasmith2015}.

\end{figure}

Lapicque's model has been elaborated in the \textit{leaky
integrate-and-fire} (LIF) \index{neuron model!leaky-integrate-and-fire}
model, which introduces a numerical ``leak''
into the model, that acts as a type of memory \index{memory}
for the neuron integration \cite{Eliasmith2004, Eliasmith2015}.
Input voltages decays exponentially over time, meaning that the
present voltage depends more strongly on recent input voltages
\cite[p. 86]{Eliasmith2004}.
By controlling the resistance (or leak), it is possible to
control the time with which previous voltages are 'forgotten'
\cite{Eliasmith2004}.

To align digital representations with neural spikes,
signals are encoded and decoded when entering and leaving the system
respectively \cite{Dayan2001}.
Because of the temporal nature of spiking neural networks, probability

\subsection{\Gls{NN}s as directed graphs}
Following the above descriptions, \gls{NN}s can be abstracted as a 
directed graph: circuits of computational units connected through
weighted, directed edges \cite{Dayan2001, Eliasmith2004, Russel2007}.
Figure \ref{fig:nn-example} illustrates such a network.
The layered design is typical for first and second generation networks, but 
can be generalised to the third generation as well, despite their parallel
nature.
The second layer is traditionally denoted as `hidden' because it is only
stimulated indirectly \cite{Russel2007}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\tikzset{%
  every neuron/.style={
    circle, draw, minimum size=0.5cm
  },
  neuron dots/.style={
    draw=none,
    scale=1.5,

\begin{tikzpicture}{x=1.5cm, y=1.5cm}
  \foreach \m [count=\y] in {1,2,dots,n}
    \node [every neuron/.try, neuron \m/.try](input-\m) at (0, 2.5-\y) {};
  \foreach \m [count=\y] in {1, dots, n}
    \node [every neuron/.try, neuron \m/.try](hidden-\m) at (2, 2-\y) {};
  \foreach \m [count=\y] in {1, dots, n}
    \node [every neuron/.try, neuron \m/.try](output-\m) at (4, 2-\y) {};

  \foreach \l [count=\i] in {1, 2, n}
    \draw [<-] (input-\l) -- ++ (-1, 0)
      node [above, midway] {$I_{\l}$};
  \node [above] at (hidden-1.north) {$H_1$};
  \node [below] at (hidden-n.south) {$H_n$};

  \foreach \f in {1, 2, n}
    \foreach \t in {1, n}
      \draw [->] (input-\f) -- (hidden-\t);
  \foreach \f in {1, n}
    \foreach \t in {1, n}
      \draw [->] (hidden-\f) -- (output-\t);
  \foreach \l [count=\i] in {1,n}
    \draw [->] (output-\l) -- ++(1,0)
	node [above, midway] {$O_\l$};

  \foreach \l [count=\x from 0] in {Input, Hidden, Output}
    \node [align=center, above] at (\x*2,2) {\l};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{An example neural network with a single hidden layer.}
\label{fig:nn-example}
\end{figure}

In this representation an `input' is a stimulus vector, whose
length is equal to the number of neurons in the first layer.
Conversely, an `output' is a vector whose length
is controlled by the number of output neurons.
A \gls{NN} can then be understood as a function $f$ that 
maps an input vector to an output vector of arbitrary size
\cite{Russel2007}.

\section{Learning} \index{learning} \label{sec:learnin}
Defining an \gls{agent} as a system that can act on previous knowledge
\cite{Russel2007}, learning in the context of an \gls{agent}
refers to ``the process of gaining
information through observation'' \cite{sep:learning-formal}.

Following the above abstraction of neural networks as computations over vectors,
``learning'' \index{learning} can be understood as the development of consistent
patterns, given the same input.
Within the \gls{ml} literature, this is commonly referred to as 
\textit{prediction}. \index{predict}
In practice this is expressed in terms of general functions or
\textit{rules} \index{rule} in a network \cite[p. 704.]{Russel2007}.

Within machine learning \gls{ml} three types of
learning exists: supervised, \index{learning!supervised}
unsupervised \index{learning!unsupervised} and reinforced.
\index{learning!reinforcement}

\textit{Supervised} learning relies on a set of expected outputs which 
the learning \gls{agent} must predict, given some input \cite{Russel2007}.
The \gls{agent} is told how `wrong' it was, so it can adapt accordingly.
This learning typically happens in a \textit{training} and \textit{testing}
phase, where the \gls{agent} is allowed to builds its internal representation
which is later tested previously unseen data \cite{Russel2007}.

\textit{Unsupervised} learning asks the \gls{agent} to learn without
having any idea of error margin \cite{Russel2007}.
Rather, the \gls{agent} is asked to \textit{explore} a domain in search of
patterns, which then form the basis for future predictions or classifications
\cite{Russel2007}.

\textit{Reinforced} learning reinforces the \gls{agent} through
rewards and discourages it through punishments \cite{Russel2007}.
Contrary to supervised learning the rewards and punishments are not
instructing the agent on what the output should be, but rather how well
it performed the task, leaving the \gls{agent} to infer rules or
behaviours by itself \cite[p. 873]{Russel2007}.

The process of learning can either be \textit{inductive}
\index{learning!induction}
or \textit{deductive} \index{learning!deduction} \cite[p. 704]{Russel2007}.
The latter requires a basis in rule-based systems from which new knowledge can
be deduced, while the former requires a measurement of success \cite[p. 705]{Russel2007}.
Such a measurement is typically referred to as the \textit{error} or \textit{loss}
function\index{loss function}\index{error function|see {loss function}}
because it shows how much the prediction deviated from the expectation (success)
\cite{Russel2007}.

Learning within neural networks have shown to be possible within all three
types of learning \cite{Schmidhuber2014, Russel2007}, but deduction is rarely
seen in the \gls{NN} literature, because it is cumbersome to express neural
networks through logic transformations 
%TODO: Check citation; write about Eliasmith and DTU logics guy
Because of its simplicity and widespread use, this thesis will focus on supervised
inductive learning.

\subsection{Errors in learning}
It is worth noting that \gls{NN}s may \textit{learn} \index{learn}
rules \index{rule} that are not optimal \cite{Russel2007}.
This can happen in one of two ways: either the
network is structurally incapable of learning the domain, 
or the learned rule is incorrect \cite{Russel2007, Eliasmith2015}.

A \gls{NN} is limited in complexity by its number of nodes,
because one neuron is only capable of describing a binary
outcome \cite{Dayan2001, Russel2007}.
This is sufficient to model a dichotomy, but insufficient
to explain, say, numbers bigger than 1.
Such a structural limit cannot be solved by any other means
than augmenting the network \cite{Russel2007}.

Provided that the network is sufficiently complex, the 
learned rules can still be incorrect.
In inductive processes this is due to a misrepresentation
of data, where the data on which the network bases its
predictions, fails to capture the expectations of the
trainer \cite{Russel2007}.
To avoid this, it is customary to only train the network
on a part of the available data, only to test it on 
the remaining data \cite{Russel2007, Schmidhuber2014}.
