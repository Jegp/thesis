This chapter presents the data of the experiments described above.
Information about the system that ran them, as well as the full data from
the experiments themselves as are available in Appendix
\ref{app:experiment}.

All experiments have been executed 10 times, and the results reported here
are accumulations of the prediction accuracies and errors.
Because all layers uses a constant seed in Futhark, the results are constant and
standard deviations have been omitted.
The experiments use a 80/20 training/testing split. 

\section{NAND}

Data from the NAND experiment is shown in Table \ref{tab:xor}.
The rates are below chance levels in NEST, both during
the random weight initialisation and while transferring weights from Futhark.
