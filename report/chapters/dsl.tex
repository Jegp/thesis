This first chapter of the thesis motivates and defines
a \gls{DSL} for the modelling of general \gls{NN}s.
The first part of the chapter presents the theory behind second and third
generation \gls{NN}s, so as to posit requirements for the language. 
Finally this chapter will present the \gls{DSL} \index{Volr},
as a means to translate cognitive concepts into computational \gls{NN}
models.

\section{Neural networks}
\Gls{NN}s is a broad term that originates in the neuronal models from
biological brain \cite{Dayan2001}.
The general architecture of neural systems can be explained as circuits
of neurons \index{neuron} connected through weighted edges.
\cite{Russel2007, Dayan2001}.
In this abstract sense a neuron is defined as a computational unit that
takes a number of signals (inputs) and processes them through some
function $f$ that outputs a single value \cite{Eliasmith2004}.
From that perspective neural networks simply \textit{computes} an 
output based on some input why neural networks can be understood as
complex non-linear computations \cite{Eliasmith2004, Dayan2001}.

In a more concrete sense neural networks computes over either
continuous (e. g. voltage and numbers) or discrete signal, and they
can be modelled with or without a temporal dimension
\cite{Eliasmith2004, Russel2007, Schmidhuber2014}.

Common for many of the models are that they enrich the
input signals ($x$) with a weight as shown in \ref{eq:weightedsum}
\cite{Schmidhuber2014, Russel2007}. 
Given $n$ input neurons, the weighted sum is the value of each
input neuron scaled by a weight for that individual neuron.
Weights allow the model to adapt the relative importance of each
input neuron by modifying their weights, thus allowing the
model to \textit{train} to a given domain \cite{Schmidhuber2014, Russel2007}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:weightedsum}
u = w \cdot x = \sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i
\end{equation}

Discrete models without a temporal dimension were the foundation for
the first generation of neural networks \cite{Russel2007, Maass1997}.
They are based on the perceptron model as seen in equation
\ref{eq:perceptron}, also known as the McCulluch-Pitts neuron model
\cite{Eliasmith2004}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:perceptron}
f(x) = \begin{cases}
	 1 & \text{if } u > 0\\
	 0 & \text{otherwise}
       \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Second generation neural networks}
Second generation neural networks augment the perceptron model by
a) allowing continuous output values of a neuron and b) parameterising
the computation of the neuron by adding an \textit{activation function}
\index{activation function} for when the output ``activates'' 
\cite{Maass1997}.
\textit{Sigmoidal} functions are commonly used for activation functions
because they resemble the perceptron step function while 
retatining continuity (see figure \ref{fig:sigmoid})
\cite{Maass1997}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[domain=-6:6,xscale=0.3]
  \draw[->] (-6.2,0) -- (6.2,0) node[right] {$x$};
  \draw[->] (0,-0.2) -- (0,1.2) node[above] {$\sigma(x)$};
  \draw plot (\x,{1 / (1 + exp(-\x))}) node[right] {$\sigma(x) = {1 \over 1 + e^{-x}}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{A sigmoidal (soft step) function.}
\label{fig:sigmoid}
\end{figure}

A number of variations for sigmoidal activation functions exist such as the 
hyperbolic tangent ($tanh$) and
the rectified linear unit \index{ReLU} (ReLU, see equation \ref{eq:ReLU}). 
They are applied either in a feedforward or recurrent (cyclic) manner, where
the recurrent variant are forced to cope with temporal transformations to
terminate\footnote{It is possible to \textit{unfold} recurrent
networks to resemble the circular processes until a certain point, achieving
a similar effect to temporal signal transformation, see \cite{Mozer1995}.}
\cite{Schmidhuber2014}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ReLU}
f(x) = \begin{cases}
         0 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
	 x & \text{otherwise}
       \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Third generation neural networks}
Constructing a network of neuron models essentially creates a non-linear
response to a given numerical vector \cite{Russel2007}.
This transformative view can be adopted to biological \gls{NN}, where
the data being transferred are no longer vectors, but discrete
\textit{spikes} of electrical current \cite[p. 32]{Dayan2001, Eliasmith2004}.
In this case the activation of a spike can be understood as a function
of the electric current to the neuron cell along with the cell weights,
similar to the weighted sum in equation \ref{eq:weightedsum}
\cite[p. 234]{Dayan2001}.

There is a temporal dimension to this because signals in biological 
networks arrive from multiple sources in parallel \cite{Eliasmith2004}.
Lapicque presented the first model of conductance over time in 1907,
dubbed the \textit{integrate-and-fire} model, because neurons essentially
integrate received current over time to determine whether they should fire 
\cite{Dayan2001, Eliasmith2004}.
The Dirac ($\delta$) function in figure \ref{eq:dirac} shows an idealised
version of this \cite[p. 404]{Dayan2001}.
For all values it approaches 0, except when its argument is
0 where it will grow infinitely.
The total area of these 'spikes' sum together to 1 over time $t$.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dirac}
\int dt\ \delta(t) = 1
\end{equation}

This idealised representation is a common mathematical approximation of
a sequence of activation functions \cite{Dayan2001, Eliasmith2004},
and the foundation for the \textit{third} generation
neural networks, where the computations are understood as spikes over
time \cite{Maass1997}.
In this model the neurons receive a voltage that builds over time, until
it reaches a threshold voltage ($V_{th}$) and produces a single spike
\mbox{($\delta(t-t_n)$)}
\cite{Dayan2001, Eliasmith2004}.
In a brief period after the activation the neuron enters a period of
refraction, where injected voltage is not accumulated, denoted by 
$\tau_{ref}$, illustrated in figure \ref{fig:spiking}.

\end{figure}


Lapicque's model has been elaborated in the \textit{leaky
integrate-and-fire} model, which introduces a numerical ``leak''
into the model, that acts as a \textit{weight} for the neuron integration
\cite{Eliasmith2004, Eliasmith2015}.

\subsubsection{Encoding and decoding in spiking neural networks}
To align digital representations with neural spikes,
signals are encoded and decoded when entering and leaving the system
respectively \cite{Dayan2001}.
Because of the temporal nature of spiking neural networks, probability
distributions are commonly used to describe 
Given a current for background firing rates
Assuming there are $n$ inputs to a neuron with $i$ bits of information,
an encoder

\section{Similar work}
A vast amount of work has been put into the development of software for simulating
neural networks.
This section covers the most popular and recent projects for both second and third
generation frameworks, and extracts relevant
features for use in the requirements section \ref{sec:requirements}.

\subsection{Second generation software}
The perhaps most noteable product for this type of networks is the Tensorflow \index{Tensorflow}
framework \cite{Abadi2016}.
Tensorflow is essentially an infrastructure for the description and execution of directed graph 
structures,
that connects varying activation functions and learning mechanisms through the common abstraction
of tensors \cite{Abadi2015}.
It is a large collaboration of multiple companies and organisations, who have
grown a comprehensive library of both code as well as infrastructure, and they
provide extensive hardware acceleration \cite{Abadi2015}.

The primary advantage of Tensorflow \index{Tensorflow} arrives from 
its foundation in tensors as a general abstraction that
can be applied to a wide array of problems \cite{Abadi2016}.
Other frameworks have adapted a similar approach, such as PyTorch \cite{PyTorch2018}, 
scikit-learn \cite{Sklearn2018}, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) \cite{CNTK2018},
Caffe \cite{Caffe2018} and Theano \cite{Theano2018}.
The mentioned products differ slightly in terms of syntax and objective\footnote{Especially
PyTorch and Caffe targets \gls{DL}} as well as integrations for data and services, but
all rely on second generation \gls{NN} architecture.

Lasagne and Keras are examples of products that works with higher-level abstractions,
building on Theano and Tensorflow respectively \cite{Lasagne2018, Keras2018}.
They both provide imperative \gls{API}s for constructing models in steps, while
including useful utilities for the molding of data to fit the underlying tensor structures.

In terms of learning the frameworks are diverse, although gradient descent 
and auto-differentiation are among the most common features 
(seen in Tensorflow, PyTorch, CNTK, Theano
and Caffe). 
% TODO: Write about unsupervised/reinforcement learning?

The Open Neural Network Exchange Format (ONNX) is an open data format for the representation
of \gls{DL} learning models \cite{ONNX2018}. 
In this context ONNX is interesting because it attempts to describe the networks as 
a directed graph, just like Tensorflow.
ONNX is supported by Caffe, CNTK and Pytorch, and translate to Tensorflow,
indicating that a directed graph is 
sufficiently generic to model the structure and learning tasks within 
second generation networks.

\subsection{Third generation software}
The landscape for third generation software is less uniform, because the products target
wider applications.
In general 


PyNN is a simulator-independent

\section{DSL requirements} \label{sec:requirements}

% Both types of network are architecturally similar, and both are conceived from
% the same physiological principles \autocite{dayan2001, russel2007, Nilsson2009, schmidhuber2014}.
% The implementations, however, vary greatly.

% To ensure internal and external validity in and between the two network types,
% it is desirable that the models are as closely related from a theoretical and
% practical perspective as possible.
% Additionally, to test the hypothesis, it is required that both the artificial
% and spiking models can be simulated on regular machine architecture, while
% the spiking model requires a neuromorphic hardware platform.

% An optimal approach would be to find a tool that leverages the similarities
% of the network types, while integrating with the diverse simulated or emulated
% targets.
% That is, an abstract model of neural networks that can translate into
% heterogeneous back-ends, while retaining a high degree of inter-model validity.

% A number of general frameworks for artificial neural networks
% exist\footnote{
%   Among others, see \autocite{ONNX2018}, \autocite{PyTorch2018}, \autocite{TensorFlow2018},
%   \autocite{Keras2018} and DyNet \autocite{Neubig2017}.
% }, but none of them extend to the spiking domain.
% Conversely a number of choices exist for neuromorphic modelling\footnote{
%   %TODO: Find sources on internal IBM/Intel stuff
% }, but they exclusively evaluate to neuromorphic or spiking neural network
% backends \autocite{Jordan2018}.
