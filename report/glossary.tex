  description = {
    Artificial neural networks is a broad term for connected units with 
    weighted edges.
    Each unit is roughly modelled over the biological neuron, in the way 
    that they can receive a number of inputs (dendrites) 
    but only provide a single output (axon).
    They also typicall use sigmoidal activation functions to calculate the 
    unit responses.
    This broad definition covers both third and second generation neural
    networks, and is generally avoided througout the thesis to avoid 
    ambiguity}
