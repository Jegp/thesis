%TODO: Data on hardware

This section includes all generated scripts used to evaluate the experiments for
completion. 
They are all generated through the Volr compiler that is included in Appendix
\ref{app:implementation}.

\section{Execution wrapper}

A wrapper was written for the experiments to ensure a homogenous execution from
the commandline as well as data injection and extraction via standard in/out.
